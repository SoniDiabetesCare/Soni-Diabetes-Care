                         Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) develops in some women during the pregnancy, in the second trimester. In GDM placental factors interfere with insulin action resulting in high blood sugar. This is a special type of diabetes because in pregnancy diagnostic criteria and treatment goals both are different from normal Type 2 DM.
                    </p>
                    <p className="sdcbp2">
                         As we know GDM is basically related to the state of pregnancy, so this type of diabetes goes away after the birth of the baby. However, on the negative note, if you've had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes in future if preventive measures and lifestyle changes are not made and implemented.

               <p className="sdcbp3"> 
                    Diabetes means high blood sugar. It is either due to insulin resistance or insulin deficiency. If the blood vessels in our body are exposed to such high level of sugar for a longer time then it eventually leads in damaging inner part of these blood vessels (the mechanism is complex) which ultimately leads to small thrombus (blockage) and occlusion of these blood vessels causing damage to various organs like kidney, retina, nerves, heart and brain; even if you are an asymptomatic diabetes patient. 
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp4">
                    It is advisable for a diabetic patient to control their blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol level to prevent these future complications.

The longer the person has diabetes- particularly out-of-control diabetes- the higher their risk of heart disease.

                                   Diabetes reduces circulation. Since proper blood supply to a wound is required for healing, reduced circulation means that the wounds would take longer time to heal as compared to the normal time. This is true, especially in the feet which are the farthest extremities, and diabetes is the leading cause of lower limb amputation. Diabetics must always be aware of wounds, particularly foot wounds, since the impaired blood supply can mean that these wounds and infections will not heal, and will lead to gangrene.

So to prevent these disastrous complications a diabetic patient is always advised to keep blood sugar under control as per recommendation.

                    How to prevent diabetes?

               <p className="sdcbp6">
                    Type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Unmanaged diabetes may lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, and other serious conditions. Before diagnosis of type 2 dm, your blood sugar levels may be high — but not high enough to indicate diabetes. This is known as prediabetes.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp7">
                    Around 5-10% of people with prediabetes become diabetic annually and According to an ADA expert panel, up to 70% of individuals with prediabetes will eventually develop diabetes.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp8">
                    Prediabetes is basically the early phase of type 2 diabetes and these  are lifestyle based diseases. Living a healthy lifestyle and warding off some bad habits can significantly help control your blood sugar levels and prevent complications associated with this condition.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp9">
                    Here are some simple lifestyle tips to prevention of diabetes from pre-diabetic condition:
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp10">
                    &#9679;
                    Lose weight: Obesity or excess weight, particularly around the abdomen is a major factor for high blood sugar.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp11">
                    &#9679;
                    Get more active: Doing physical activity regularly may help prevent diabetes.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp12">
                    &#9679;
                    Eat right:  No matter how many hours you spend on the treadmill, if you don't make changes in the kitchen, it won't help. You cannot come from your workout and have a pizza and expect blood sugar levels to fall.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcbp13">
                    &#9679;
                    Reduce your portion sizes: Eating portion sizes appropriate for your needs may also help prevent diabetes.

                    No single food can do it all — but it goes without saying that some foods are healthier than others. A leafy salad is healthier than a plate of fries; a salmon filet is healthier than a loaded cheeseburger; a yogurt parfait is healthier than a hot fudge sundae.
