                    Let's understand the basics of diabetes. Glucose, or also known as Blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It comes from the food we consume and acts as the body's main source of energy. Your blood then carries this sugar to all of your body's cells in order to use it and convert it into energy.

               <p className="sdcdep2">
                    Now let's acknowledge diabetes. It is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose level is too high compared to the normal level irrespective of cause. This is also known as 'Diabetes Mellitus'. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) the following is the diagnostic criteria for Diabetes.

                         Understanding the basic pathology of diabetes, it si divided majorly into two types. Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Insulin, a hormone made by beta cells of the pancreas, helps to glucose entry into the cells and keep the blood glucose in normal level. This glucose molecule generates energy for normal functioning of body cells. Sometimes insulin is not able to work well at cellular level known as insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), or sometimes your body doesn't make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes).

                    <p className="sdcdep6">
                         Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease. In simple terms, some antibodies in your blood kill beta cells of pancreas. The beta cells are the main source to produce insulin hormone in your body. So your pancreas fails to produce insulin hormone, patients develop insulin deficiency and need lifelong insulin as insulin replacement therapy, and no other treatment options are available till date. Type 1 Diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can occur at any age.

                    <p className="sdcdep7">
                         Type 2 diabetes is basically a metabolic disease, in which insulin does not work properly (means insulin resistance). The factors which increase insulin resistance in the body is Obesity and Poor physical activity; clearly stating it being a lifestyle disease. In the early phase of Type 2 diabetes (pre diabetes phase) your pancreas tries to produce excess insulin to control your blood sugar to overcome the resistance but after 3-5 years of this stage, overburdened pancreas wears off and becomes tired and fails to produce enough amount of insulin and your blood sugar level starts to rise. This type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. It is the most common type of diabetes. In type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, initially patients could be managed with dietary changes, physical activity and oral drugs but later on they also need insulin to control their blood sugar.

                    So to diagnose early, and fight against diabetes my request to you is that if anyone experiencing symptoms of diabetes should visit a doctor for advice and treatment. If you are experiencing following symptoms, it is highly recommended to seek a doctor for a blood glucose test:

                    Prediabtes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is basically a mild form of type 2 DM. Although blood sugar is not so high in prediabetic patients, cardiovascular risk is as equal to normal diabetic patients. So this population also needs medical advice in the form of dietary restrictions, physical exercise and some medications according to their body weight.

                    Insulin, a pancreatic hormone, is responsible for glucose utilization in our body. Due to some metabolic issue, this insulin hormone is not able to perform its function and now in this situation our pancreas makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond, this is called as insulin resistance and eventually our pancreas can't keep up and our blood glucose level starts to increases after some time, setting the stage for prediabetes-and type 2 diabetes down the road. So in the prediabetes stage basic pathology is the same as type 2 diabetes, with effective measures (lifestyle modifications) we can prevent type 2 diabetes disease.

                    Insulin is a hormone produced by pancreas in the body. Its main function is to promote uptake of glucose by cells, and keep sugar under control. If a normal person consumed excess amounts of glucose or sugar or sweets, then all the glucose in the body entered into cells by the help of insulin and kept the blood sugar in normal level, but if due to some disease the pancreas not able to produce insulin, resulting in insulin deficiency know as type 1 diabetes.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep17">
                    In India, still there is fear for insulin therapy among diabetic patients, actually insulin is not a punishment, it's just an replacement therapy if there is deficiency so a diabetic patient should take insulin if required and finally as this is a natural molecule, it works without any adverse effects.

               <p className="sdcdep18">
                    Insulin is not available in oral formulation, it comes in injection and nasal spray. Most easily available in India is injections and before starting insulin therapy you should consult a diabetes doctor for complete insulin education. Few important tips are as follows:-
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep19">
                    &#9679;
                    Insulin should be kept in freeze at a temperature between 2 - 8 degree centigrade.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep20">
                    &#9679;
                    Insulin injection should be taken as a subcutaneous injection over abdomen, thigh and arm. It can be self-administered by a patient and modern needles are almost painless.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep21">
                    &#9679;
                    Do not inject near joints, the grain area, the navel, the middle of the abdomen, or scar tissue.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep22">
                    &#9679;
                    You will also need to rotate, or switch, your injection sites. If you use the same injection site over and over again, you may develop hardened areas under your skin that keep the insulin from working properly.
               </p>

                    Insulin is an anabolic hormone which provides glucose to muscles, fatty tissue, liver and all cells of the body. Glucose is the main source of energy for our cells. In the absence of insulin, all glucose remains in circulating blood and results in high blood glucose. In this scenario our muscles or other cells start to oxidize fatty acid to get energy and the end result is production of ketone and acid known as Diabetic Keto-Acidosis, a life threatening emergency for Type 1 Diabetes.
               </p>
               <p className="sdcdep16">
                    To prevent keto-acidosis in type 1 diabetes, insulin is essential. Science has been working on insulin for the last 100 years. Now we have very good quality of insulin by which we can prevent keto-acidosis in type 1 diabetes as well as control the blood sugar to the target level in diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes also requires insulin when oral drugs fail to control blood sugar to the target level.

                    When you eat extra calories and fat, your body creates an undesirable rise in blood glucose. If blood glucose isn't kept in check, it can lead to serious problems, such as a high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia) that, if persistent, may lead to long-term complications, such as nerve, kidney and heart damage.

                    Carbohydrates in our diet are the main source of glucose. After complete digestion of carbohydrates, glucose comes as the final products and goes into blood, from where it is available to every cell and with help of insulin it enters into cells and produces energy for normal functions of our tissue. Overall carbs are essential for us to consume in our diet for energy but we have to choose in a smart way so we get glucose but not excess glucose.

                         Fruits are high in fiber, low in fat and full of vitamins and minerals. It helps to protect against heart disease, cancer and certain stomach problems. Best fruits for diabetes is the most common question asked in my diabetes clinic. Before answering this question I would like to explain what is glycemic index - Glycemic index is the capacity of the food to raise the blood sugar after consumption. Fuits having low glycemic index are safe in diabetes like apples, guava, pears, oranges, peaches, apricots and berries. Some fruits like mangoes have a very high amount of fructose which should be avoided in diabetes. Some fruits should be consumed in limited quantities like papaya, watermelon, etc.

                    Proteins are the building blocks of our body, and are responsible for growth and maintenance. Everyone needs 1 gm/kg/per day of protein, essential for muscles, and other tissues of the body. In our diet we need protein but one thing to keep in mind is that while consuming protein sometimes we eat excess carbs and fats, so we need to choose protein in smarter ways for a diabtes patient.

               <p className="sdcdep34">
                    A diabetes patient should prefer protein from veg sources, milk products and egg protein, instead of non-veg sources like mutton or beef, because non-veg food in India is having high contents of bad fats and salt which are responsible for high cholesterol and hypertension.

While it's always good to push yourself, be careful not to push too far. You can't go from doing nothing to everything overnight. So take your time and be consistent for healthy blood sugar levels.
