          "question": "What is diabetes?",
          "answer": "Diabetes means high blood sugar, is a disease in which blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal. As per ADA, if your fasting blood glucose is >126 mg/dL, or 2 hours after oral glucose tolerance test blood sugar is >200 mg/dL, or HbA1c is more than 6.5%. It is sufficient to say you are having diabetes. Glucose is the main source of energy for us and comes from diet and a pancreatic hormone insulin helps glucose to get into cells of our body. When our body either does not produce enough insulin or is unable to perform functions, blood sugar starts to rise. Diabetes if not controlled by proper management can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations."

          "answer": "Although diabetes has various symptoms but most of the people remain asymptomatic in diabetes, hence called as 'silent killer'. Few symptoms of diabetes are as follows:-<br/>A. Frequent urination or Nocturia (excessive urination in night)<br/>B. Excessive thirst<br/>C. Unexplained weight loss<br/>D. Extreme hunger<br/>E. Vision problems<br/>F.

          "answer": "Diabetes has many types but mostly are divided into two types<br/>A. Type 1 diabetes is basically an autoimmune disorder and a state of insulin deficiency, requiring lifelong insulin replacement therapy.<br/>B. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease, in which insulin actions become poor so patients need dietary advice, exercise and drugs to control blood sugar."

          "answer": "If you are recently diagnosed with diabetes or have had diabetes for years, you should consult a diabetes doctor and understand about the disease. Diabetes is a metabolic disease and most of the time obesity, hypertension and high lipid levels are associated. All of these are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and need special care for patients. A diabetic doctor understands these things in a better way and provides specialized care to not only control blood sugar but to live a healthy life and prevent future complications."

It may be possible that you are not following diabetic diet and not doing proper physical activity or not taking medication at the right time. Second thing is that your disease needs higher medicine or the whole diagnosis may be wrong, in that case you need to consult your doctor."

Any product with a high glycemic index (Glycemic index is the capacity of the food to raise the blood sugar after consumption) should be avoided.<br/>Household sugar commonly known in India as 'chinni' and fruits with high fructose content like mango should not be consumed by a diabetic patient.<br/>First of all before what and how to eat, we should know about how much calorie per day we need to consume. Besides counting calories, a simple advice from my point of view is a diabetic diet should have low carbs, good but low fat, high fiber, adequate protein from specially milk and veg sources."

          "answer": "Fruits are high in fiber, low in fat and full of vitamins and minerals. It helps to protect against heart disease, cancer and certain stomach problems. Best fruits for diabetes is the most common question asked in my diabetes clinic. Before answering this question I would like to explain what is glycemic index - Glycemic index is the capacity of the food to raise the blood sugar after consumption. Fruits having low glycemic index are safe in deabetes like apples, guava, pears, oranges, peaches, apricots and berries. Some fruits like mangoes have a very high amount of fructose which should be avoided in diabetes. Some fruits should be consumed in limited quantities like papaya, watermelon etc."

For a non-diabetic patient it must be less than 5.7 (As per ADA) and for diabetic patients it is advisable to keep HbA1c less than 7.0 to reduce the risk of future complications."

          "question": "If it is sugar free, I can eat as much as I want, right?",
          "answer": "Let's understand what sugarfree means - non-carbohydrate sweeteners, these are special chemicals which are sweet in test but they don't have glucose/fructose or sucrose, so basically known as sugar free sweeteners. Some are approved to use for diabetic population like sucralose (in market it is known as sugar free natura) but one thing to keep in mind is that every food item has calorie and if you are eating anything in large quantity with added sugar free means you are taking high amount of calorie which is not good for a diabetic patient. So you can use sugar free in very limited quantities to make your food sweet when necessary... Remember, moderation is the key and with diabetes... you need to be extra careful."
